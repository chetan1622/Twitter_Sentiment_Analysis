**Files Included**

Final.ipynb: Final version of the sentiment analysis pipeline.

Sentiment_twitter.ipynb: Earlier or working version of the notebook (or experimentation notebook).

**Features**

1. Real-time tweet analysis using keyword search (optional).
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing (stopwords removal, stemming, etc.).
3. Vectorization using TF-IDF/CountVectorizer.
4. Classification using machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.).
5. Performance evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.

**Technologies Used**

1. Python
2. Jupyter Notebook
3. Pandas, NumPy (libraries)
4. Scikit-learn
5. NLTK / TextBlob (To get access to Twitter (X))
6. Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
